# Saw

A cutting tool for woodworking, consisting of a tough blade with a hard toothed edge.

## Overview

The workshop has several types of saws available:
- **Hand Saw** - General purpose crosscut saw for rough cuts
- **Back Saw** - Fine-toothed saw for precision work
- **Coping Saw** - For curved cuts and intricate work
- **Hacksaw** - For cutting metal and plastic
- **Table Saw** - Stationary power saw for ripping boards (requires safety training)
- **Circular Saw** - Portable power saw (requires safety training)
- **Miter Saw** - For precise angled cuts (requires safety training)

## Location

Hand saws hang on the tool wall. Power saws are in the power tool area.

## Basic Usage

### Hand Sawing
1. Mark your cut line clearly
2. Secure the workpiece so it won't move
3. Support both sides of the cut to prevent binding
4. Start the cut with short, light strokes
5. Let the saw do the work - don't force it
6. Keep the saw perpendicular to the work surface
7. Use long, smooth strokes for efficiency

### Power Saw Safety
**Power saws require safety training before use. See the shop manager for certification.**

- Always wear safety glasses and hearing protection
- Keep hands away from the blade
- Never reach over or behind the blade
- Unplug when changing blades
- Wait for blade to stop completely before moving workpiece
- Use push sticks for small pieces
- No loose clothing or jewelry
- Keep work area clean of sawdust and debris

## Maintenance

### Daily Care
- Clean sawdust from power saws after use
- Check blade tightness on power saws
- Wipe hand saw blades clean
- Return to proper storage location

### Problems to Report
- Dull blades
- Damaged or missing teeth
- Bent blades
- Loose or damaged guards on power saws
- Unusual sounds or vibration from power saws
- Frayed power cords

## Tips and Tricks

- **Choosing teeth per inch (TPI)**: Lower TPI (5-8) for fast, rough cuts. Higher TPI (12-20) for smooth, precise cuts
- **Preventing binding**: Keep blade perpendicular and support both sides of the cut
- **Curved cuts**: Use a coping saw or jigsaw, cut on the waste side of the line
- **Metal cutting**: Use proper metal-cutting blade, slower speed, cutting oil
- **Preventing tear-out**: Score cut line first, or use tape on cut line
- **Table saw accuracy**: Use the fence for rip cuts, miter gauge for crosscuts

## When to Use a Different Tool

- **Very thick material**: May need a reciprocating saw
- **Precise small cuts**: Consider using a chisel or knife
- **Large sheets**: Table saw or circular saw with guide
- **Curves and scrollwork**: Scroll saw or coping saw
- **Demolition**: Reciprocating saw or oscillating multi-tool
