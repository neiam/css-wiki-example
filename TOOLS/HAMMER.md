# Hammer

A versatile hand tool for driving nails, fitting parts, forging metal, and breaking objects apart.

## Overview

The workshop has several types of hammers available:
- **Claw Hammer** - General purpose, 16oz, good for framing and finish work
- **Ball-peen Hammer** - For metalworking and shaping
- **Rubber Mallet** - For assembly work where you don't want to mar surfaces
- **Sledgehammer** - For heavy demolition work
- **Dead Blow Hammer** - Sand-filled head prevents bounce-back

## Location

Hammers are stored on the tool wall in the main workshop area, organized by type. The claw hammer lives in the general toolbox.

## Basic Usage

### Driving Nails
1. Hold hammer near the end of the handle for maximum leverage
2. Start nail with light taps while holding it steady
3. Once nail is started, let go and use full swings
4. Hit nail squarely on the head
5. For finish work, use a nail set to avoid hammer marks

### Pulling Nails (Claw Hammer)
1. Slip claw under nail head
2. Rock hammer back using handle as lever
3. For long nails, place a block under the hammer head for better leverage
4. Pull straight to avoid bending the nail

### Safety
- **Always wear safety glasses** - Flying nails or metal chips can cause eye injury
- Check that hammer head is secure before each use
- Keep fingers away from strike zone
- Make sure work is secured and won't move when struck
- Don't use the side of the hammer head
- Check surroundings before swinging

## Maintenance

### Daily Care
- Wipe clean after use
- Check that head is tight on handle
- Store in designated location

### Problems to Report
- Loose hammer head
- Cracked or splintered handle
- Mushroomed striking surface (especially on sledgehammer)
- Chipped claw

## Tips and Tricks

- **Pilot holes**: For hardwood, drill a pilot hole first to prevent splitting
- **Leverage**: Choking up on the handle gives more control, end of handle gives more power
- **Starting small nails**: Use needle-nose pliers to hold small nails or brads
- **Removing stubborn nails**: Use two hammers - one as a fulcrum for better leverage
- **Metalworking**: Let the weight of the hammer do the work, don't force it

## When to Use a Different Tool

- **Delicate assembly**: Consider rubber mallet or dead blow hammer
- **Precision metalwork**: May need specialized metalworking hammers
- **Very large nails/spikes**: May need a heavier sledgehammer
- **Tight spaces**: May need a tack hammer or small ball-peen
